# Pandas: The Powerhouse of Data Manipulation with 3 Important Methods
## Description
This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to use some of the most essential methods in the Pandas library for data importing, cleaning, and statistics. The script creates a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file, fills missing values, sorts the data by a column, and computes basic statistics.
